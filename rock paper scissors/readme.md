Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game played between two people. The game has three possible outcomes: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Here are the rules and how to play:

1. The game starts with both players extending their hand in a fist.

2. On the count of three, both players simultaneously say, "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" and make one of three hand gestures:

   - Rock: Make a fist with your hand.
   - Paper: Extend your hand flat.
   - Scissors: Extend your index and middle finger to form a V shape.

3. After making their gestures, the players reveal their choices at the same time.

4. Determine the winner based on the following outcomes:

   - Rock beats scissors: If one player shows rock and the other shows scissors, the player with rock wins.
   - Scissors beats paper: If one player shows scissors and the other shows paper, the player with scissors wins.
   - Paper beats rock: If one player shows paper and the other shows rock, the player with paper wins.

5. In the case of a tie, where both players show the same gesture, it's a draw, and the game is typically played again.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 to continue playing until a winner is determined.

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game of chance and strategy, as you try to anticipate your opponent's move while deciding your own. It's a quick and enjoyable game that can be played for fun or used to settle simple disputes.
