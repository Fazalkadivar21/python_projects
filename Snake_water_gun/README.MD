Snake Water Gun is a simple hand game often played to make quick decisions or determine a winner between two players. Here are the rules and instructions on how to play:

1. Players: The game is typically played between two people, but it can be played with more players if desired.

2. Hand Gestures:
   - Snake: Extend your hand out, making a snake-like shape by extending your thumb and little finger. It represents a snake.
   - Water: Make a fist with your hand. It represents water.
   - Gun: Extend your hand out, with your thumb raised up like a gun's barrel. It represents a gun.

3. Winning Combinations:
   - Snake beats Water: Snake "drinks" the water and wins.
   - Water beats Gun: Water "extinguishes" the gun and wins.
   - Gun beats Snake: Gun "shoots" the snake and wins.

4. Gameplay:
   - Both players simultaneously chant "Snake, Water, Gun!" and, on the last word, make one of the three hand gestures.
   - The winning combination is determined based on the hand gestures made.
   - If the hand gestures are the same (e.g., both players make a snake), it's a tie, and the game can be replayed or decided upon the agreed-upon rules.
   - Otherwise, the player with the winning combination wins the round.
   - The game can be played for a specified number of rounds, and the player with the most wins at the end is declared the overall winner.

Remember to have fun and enjoy the game!
